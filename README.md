# NLP_Group_Project-Scalable_Social_Media_Analytics

Abstract
Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter
generate huge amounts of data every day, leading to plenty
of interesting phenomenons and analysis. Our group will be
focusing on the specific topic â€“ echo chamber for this study.
In this study, we analyzed the echo chamber on social
media using a dataset from tweets related to Covid-19. Our
analysis focused on three approaches: frequently used
words with strong opinion, sentiment analysis, and polarity
over time with our hypothesis to address the phenomenon
of echo chamber. As the sentiment label is missing in our
datasets, we also applied a DistilBERT model, a
compressed version of Bert for NLP, to predict sentiment
labels for analysis purposes in the study
